# my2048
it is a remake (or some addition) to the AI2048 I have done in DTU AI course.
This is mainly for learning purpose. 

## Change

* GUI remake 

## Take away
* application and hardware interaction 
* Multithreading and possible issues and solution to concurrency problems
* Database connection 

## future development 
* test out neural network on my2048
